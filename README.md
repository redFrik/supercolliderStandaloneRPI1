# supercolliderStandaloneRPI1
Standalone for Raspberry Pi 1 or Zero with Raspbian Stretch including the full IDE.

This is the audio synthesis program [SuperCollider](http://github.com/supercollider/supercollider) (3.9.1, commit f15598c, 9feb2018) + [sc3-plugins](https://github.com/supercollider/sc3-plugins) (master, commit 9307b41, 2feb2018) compiled for rpi1 and rpi0.

It was built using [this guide](http://supercollider.github.io/development/building-raspberrypi.html) on a **Raspberry Pi Zero** under [2017-11-29-raspbian-stretch](http://raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) (Raspbian Stretch with Desktop). It also works on the **Raspberry Pi 1** model A and B.
For **Raspberry Pi 2** and **Raspberry Pi 3** use [this repository](https://github.com/redFrik/supercolliderStandaloneRPI2).

The standalone structure is loosely based on [Miguel Negr√£o's template](https://github.com/miguel-negrao/scStandalone). This standalone is self-contained and all files are in one directory (except for the sc_ide_conf.yaml file - see below). It can coexist with the Raspbian bundled scsynth used by Sonic Pi (i.e. no need to uninstall Sonic Pi and the two programs can even run simultaneously as long as Sonic Pi is started first).

installation
--

_(this assumes you have done all the usual initialisation... burned the disk image, booted, changed password, optionally enabled ssh)_

open the terminal on the RPi and type...

* `sudo apt-get update`
* `sudo apt-get upgrade`
* `sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`
* `sudo apt-get install libqt5webkit5 libqt5sensors5 libqt5positioning5 libfftw3-bin libcwiid1`
* `git clone https://github.com/redFrik/supercolliderStandaloneRPI1 --depth 1`
* `mkdir -p ~/.config/SuperCollider`
* `cp supercolliderStandaloneRPI1/sc_ide_conf_temp.yaml ~/.config/SuperCollider/sc_ide_conf.yaml`

NOTE: the last command will create a global sc_ide preference file from a template. At the moment SuperCollider IDE can not use a local configuration file, but hopefully this will change in the future. Also note that if you cloned or moved this repository somewhere else than in your home directory you should edit the yaml file with `nano ~/.config/SuperCollider/sc_ide_conf.yaml` to make the paths in there point to your standalone directory.

startup
--

To run the full IDE first open a terminal window and type...

* `qjackctl`

Select the correct soundcard (under setup/interfaces) and then start jackd. _(if usb soundcard is used also set periods to 3)_

Then open another terminal window and type...

* `cd supercolliderStandaloneRPI1`
* `export PATH=.:$PATH`
* `scide`

or just double click the desktop icon. SuperCollider IDE should start and run like normal - with scope, meter, plot, gui, animation, help, quarks etc.

KNOWN ISSUES:

* 'libEGL warning: DRI2: failed to authenticate' that is posted in terminal at scide startup is harmless

jack
--

If you start SuperCollider without having Jack already running (like when autostarting or running headless), Jack will automatically launch when you boot sc server. The audio settings then used are found in the file...

* `nano ~/.jackdrc`

_(this file is created by qjackctl so if you never ran qjackctl you might need to create this file manually.)_

The recommended jack audio settings are...

* `/usr/bin/jackd -P75 -dalsa -dhw:0 -p1024 -n3 -s -r44100`

and to set up Jack to use an external usb sound card change `-dhw:0` to `-dhw:1` like this...

* `/usr/bin/jackd -P75 -dalsa -dhw:1 -p1024 -n3 -s -r44100`

NOTE: the internal soundcard volume is by default set low (40). type `alsamixer` in terminal and adjust the pcm volume to 85 with the arrow keys, esc key exits.

autostart
--

* `sudo apt-get install xvfb`
* `crontab -e` #and add the following line to the end
* `@reboot cd /home/pi/supercolliderStandaloneRPI1 && xvfb-run ./autostart.sh`
* `sudo reboot` #and supercollider should automatically start after a while and play some beating sine tones.

Then edit the autostart script to load whichever file. By default it will load `mycode.scd`.

headless
--

To run sclang+scsynth only from ssh...

* `export DISPLAY=:0.0`
* `cd supercolliderStandaloneRPI1`
* `./sclang -a -l sclang.yaml`

NOTE: one can also specify a .scd file to load when starting sclang like this: `./sclang -a -l sclang.yaml mycode.scd`

stretch-lite
==

The standalone also works under Raspbian Stretch-lite if the following additional steps are taken...

installation:

* `sudo apt-get install git libasound2-dev libsamplerate0-dev libsndfile1-dev libreadline-dev xvfb`
* `git clone git://github.com/jackaudio/jack2.git --depth 1`
* `cd jack2`
* `./waf configure --alsa`
* `./waf build`
* `sudo ./waf install`
* `sudo ldconfig`
* `cd ..`
* `rm -rf jack2`
* `sudo nano /etc/security/limits.conf` #and add the following two lines at the end
  * `@audio - memlock 256000`
  * `@audio - rtprio 75`
* `nano ~/.jackdrc` #and add the following (use `-dhw:1` for usb soundcard)
  * `/usr/local/bin/jackd -P75 -dalsa -dhw:0 -r44100 -p1024 -n3`
* `sudo reboot`

startup:

* `cd supercolliderStandaloneRPI1`
* `xvfb-run --auto-servernum ./sclang -a -l sclang.yaml`
